# GridMapper
A map maker for simple 2d grid based games

tiles will be output as a char[][]
the array will hold chars that are going to represent the different tiles
this will eventually be editable
example tiles:
f - forest
g - grass
so on...


You will select a size (X and Y) and then fill 
in th generated grid with colours represeting the tiles
